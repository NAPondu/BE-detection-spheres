The aim here is to determine the lights angulus/intensity by using the obtained mask and the picture obtained from the neural network.

We currently have three steps in this process:
    1) Get the specularity point (most lit point in the sphere)
    2) Get the circles parameters (center position, radius)
    3) Deduct the light properties
